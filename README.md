ABSTRACT
Provided is a payment card for multiple accounts. The card comprises a card member a plurality of programmable chips, at least one of which is releasably attached to the card member; each programmable chip has an associated personal identification number (PIN ); and a control chip operable for selecting one of the programmable chips to be active during a transaction . 

FIELD
The present disclosure generally relates to payment cards for multiple accounts, and methods associated therewith. More particularly, but not exclusively, it relates to payment cards comprising a plurality of chips each associated with a corresponding account.

BACKGROUND
This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.
Payment cards such as credit cards and debit cards are very widely used for most forms of financial transaction. The use of payment cards has evolved significantly with technological developments over recent years. Originally, transactions were on paper, using an imprint of a transaction card and confirmed by a signature. This approach was largely replaced by use of a magnetic stripe of a transaction card swiped through a magnetic stripe reader on a point of sale (POS) terminal to perform a transaction. Transaction cards developed to contain an integrated circuit cards” or “smart cards”) communicate with a smart card reader in the POS terminal. Using this approach, a transact - tion   is typically confirmed by a personal   identification number (PIN) entered by the card user. Cards of this type  typically operate under the EMV standard for interoperation of chip cards and associated apparatus (such as POS termi - nals and ATMs).
Typically, most people have multiple accounts and there- fore require multiple payment cards. It may be inconvenient 45 for a person to carry a large number of payment cards as wallets have limited capacity.

SUMMARY
     This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features. Aspects and embodiments of the     disclosure are also set out in the accompanying claims.
In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, 55 there is provided a payment card for multiple accounts; the payment card generally comprises: a card member; a plurality of programmable chips, at least one of which is releasably attached to the card member; each programmable chip has an associated personal identification number (PIN); and a control chip operable for selecting one of the pro- grammable chips to be active during a transaction.
Activating the magnetic strip. In another example, the control chip is operable for In one embodiment, a programmable magnetic stripe is provided on the payment card. Advantageously, the control chip is configured to communicate with the magnetic stripe. Preferably, the control chip is configured to control the magnetic stripe. In one example, the control chip is operable for selectively selectively deactivating the magnetic stripe. In another embodiment, the control chip is configured to
 provide virtual card capabilities.
In a further embodiment, a near field communication module is provided.
In one embodiment, a biometric reader is provided. Advantageously, the biometric reader   is operable to read fingerprint.
In another embodiment, an indicator is provided for indicating the selected one of the programmable chips. Advantageously, the indicator comprises a light source associated with a corresponding one of the programmable chips.
In one embodiment, a display is provided.  In an exemplary embodiment, a power source is provided. In one example, the power source comprises a battery. In another example, the power source comprises a solar cell.
In another embodiment, the payment card is configured to derive power from a point of sale (POS) terminal (broadly, POS device) when inserted therein during a transaction. Advantageously, the POS terminal provides a menu for facilitating a user selecting one of the programmable chips to be active during the transaction.
